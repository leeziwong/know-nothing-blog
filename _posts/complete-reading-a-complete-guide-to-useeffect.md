In the article [A Complete Guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/), [Dan Abramov](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov) gave a great deep dive introduction about the *useEffect* hook.

It gives me a more clear understand about functional component render, *effect* and how to use effect correctly.

Functional render makes a heavy use of javascript closure to capture component state.

Several key points of the article:

> - Donâ€™t Lie to React About Dependencies
> - Two Ways to Be Honest About Dependencies
>   - Fix the dependency array to include all the values inside the component that are used inside the effect
>   - Making Effects Self-Sufficient

And many more well written introduction, you really should read the article.
