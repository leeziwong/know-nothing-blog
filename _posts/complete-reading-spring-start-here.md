*Spring Start Here* by Laurentiu Spilca is a detail and clear explained fundamentals Spring start book.

The author has years of experience in working with and teaching Spring makes the book content structured well and valuable.

The first part of the book explains the fundamentals of Spring, mainly about Spring IOC, Spring context and Spring AOP.

The second part of the book explains applications of Spring, including Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data etc.

I enjoy reading the book, and learn a lot from the book. Can't wait to read another book *Spring Security in Action* which is written by the same author.
